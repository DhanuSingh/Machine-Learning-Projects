# Machine-Learning-Projects
The file contains the code for implementing a convolution neural network. The classifier was trained and tested on MNIST image dataset. The implementation was part of the project comparing, a set of classifiers like Random Forest, Multi Layer Perceptron, K Nearest Neighbour and Convolutional Neural Networks. It was observed that for the given dataset CNN had better performance on metrics like accuracy, precision and recall. This was because of CNN's capability to learn a range of simple to complex features from the dataset, complex features including edges, corners, blobs etc. Also, overfitting was observed with the CNN and therefore dropout and pooling was added to remedy it.
